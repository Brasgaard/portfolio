	  		<p class="commenTxt">Working with nordnordnord was something totally different.<br> The focus was to differentiate them from other bands and their identities.<br> The main problem was that nordnordnord really didn't know their own identity<br> very well, since they are a new band. The end result was nordnordnord's<br> landingpage was animationed in different layers. This together with sound<br> created a whole new music univers.</p>
